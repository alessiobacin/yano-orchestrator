// Verifies the fix for the exact bug reported: if the broker isn't up yet
// when the client starts, mqtt.connect() (not connectAsync + throw) must
// keep retrying in the background and fire "connect" once the broker
// becomes available — matching the resilient connection logic now in
// extensions/orchestrator.ts's session_start.
//
// Usage: node scripts/smoke-test-late-broker.mjs
// (starts NO broker itself for the first few seconds on purpose)
